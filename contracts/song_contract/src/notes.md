    State Management: You have multiple functions to manage state like load_state, save_state, etc. Are they all necessary, or can some be abstracted away?

    Error Handling: The custom error type MyStdError is quite useful. However, it would be beneficial to have more specific errors for better debugging.

    Missing Approvals Logic: Functions like revoke_all and approve_all are not fully implemented. Are those part of your future plan?

    Song Metadata: I see you've enriched the NFTs with song metadata. How are you planning to use this metadata in your application?

    Token Ownership: Functions to verify token ownership seem comprehensive, but have you considered adding more utility functions for ownership?

    Test Coverage: Your test cases cover initialization and minting. You might want to add more for transfer, approval, and query functionalities.

    Code Reusability: The code seems to have a few utility functions (save_approval, remove_approval, etc.) that could be abstracted for better readability and maintainability.

    Paging in Queries: The CW-721 standard often allows paging through large sets of tokens or approvals. Your current implementation does not seem to support that.

    Event Emitting: I noticed you're adding attributes to responses to simulate events. CosmWasm supports event emitting explicitly. Do you plan to use that?

    Additional Features: Any plans for adding features like batch minting, token locking, or more complex royalty mechanisms?
